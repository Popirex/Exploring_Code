# Exploring Code

Welcome to my collection of projects developed during my university and personal journey, using JavaScript and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.  
This repository gathers simulations, visual experiments, and small interactive explorations designed to dive into concepts from physics, mathematics, and emergent behavior.

A special thanks goes to the incredible YouTuber [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague). His *Coding Adventure* series perfectly captures the spirit of creative exploration: learning the foundations of math and programming by building from scratch. I highly recommend checking out his channel if you don’t already know it and you’re interested in these topics.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Physics Simulations**  
  For example, a simplified planetary system simulation where you can tweak parameters like mass and velocity of celestial bodies.

- **Emergent Behaviors**  
  Such as the *Boids* model — a realistic representation of flocking behavior in birds, based on Craig Reynolds’ three rules: alignment, cohesion, and separation.

- **Visual Experiments**  
  Graphic sketches and creative interactions designed to visually explore algorithms or scientific concepts.

## Goal

My goal is to learn by creating.  
Each project starts with a question or curiosity and becomes a small challenge to strengthen my understanding of computer science, math, and physics.

## Technologies Used

- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) – For graphics and interactivity  
- JavaScript – For system logic and behavior  
- HTML/CSS – For structure and styling
