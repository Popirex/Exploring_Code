        <h1>Context:</h1>

        <p>
          This simulation is based on the Boids model (from English “boids,” short for “bird-oid objects”), developed in 1986 by Craig Reynolds, a pioneer in computer graphics. Its goal was to realistically reproduce the collective behavior of flocks of birds, schools of fish, or swarms of insects, using simple rules applied to individual autonomous agents.
        <br><br>
        The emergent flocking behavior arises from the interaction of three fundamental rules:
        <br>
        -<strong>Alignment</strong> (tend to move in the same direction as nearby agents). <br>
        -<strong>Cohesion</strong> (move closer to other group members). <br>
        -<strong>Repulsion</strong> (avoid collisions by maintaining a minimum distance).  <br>
        <br><br>
        In this simulation, you can observe and adjust the flock’s behavior using dedicated sliders, experimenting in real time with how small parameter changes affect collective dynamics. Additionally, there is a slider that, when activated, shows the connections between a “bird” and others within a 100-pixel radius. This is a clear example of how complex phenomena can emerge from very simple local rules.

        <h1>Update - September 2, 2025</h1>

        <p>
          I started experimenting with the Map function (built into JavaScript, and supported in p5.js) to create a hash table. This allows me to significantly optimize the program, since distances between objects are now checked based on their position within a grid.
        </p>

        <p>
           I built a new, optimized and improved version; however, unlike the one on this page, it isn’t interactive. You can view it by clicking the link below.
